### Vehicle-Dynamics B final Project

This final project is a part of the requirements of the course  Vehicle Dynamics B (ME41116) at TU Delft done by MSc Mechanical Engineering students Varun Kotian, Nikhil Nagendra, Shantanu Shivankar, and Yen-Lin Wu. 
This project aims to analyze the effect ABS brings about and how they perform on roads with different friction. A total of 9 tests are performed in the category of 
1. without controller,
2. with LQR controller, 
3. with PID controller 
on roads with 
1. friction coefficient &mu = 1,
2. friction coefficient &mu = 0.5,
3. &mu - split (leftside &mu=0.5; rightside &mu = 1)
