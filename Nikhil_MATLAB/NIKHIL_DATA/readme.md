1.  W_controller_1mu_straight - This data is for ABS maneuver **with** LQR controller. The car travels straight for 300m and then brakes in a high mu (1) road.
2.  WO_controller_1mu_straight - This data is for ABS maneuver **without** LQR controller. The car travels straight for 300m and then brakes in a high mu(1) road.
3.  W_controller_straight - This data is for ABS maneuver **with** LQR controller. The car travels straight for 300m and then brakes in a low mu (0.5) road.
4.  WO_controller_straight - This data is for ABS maneuver **without** LQR controller. The car travels straight for 300m and then brakes in a low mu (0.5) road.
5.  W_controller_straight_mu_split - This data is for ABS maneuver **with** LQR controller. The car travels straight for 300m and then brakes in a road with the left lane in high mu (1) and the right lane in low mu(0.5).
6.  WO_controller_straight_mu_split - This data is for ABS maneuver **without** LQR controller. The car travels straight for 300m and then brakes in a road with the left lane in high mu (1) and the right lane in low mu(0.5).
